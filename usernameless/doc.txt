Goal:
=====

Use django.contrib.auth.models.User based authentication and
django-registration "DefaultBackend", but without the
username. That is, only based on the email. To do that, we need to override

* the backend for authentication
* the backend for registration
* the form for authentication
* the form for registration

That's what this application does.
To use it, load the registration default backend url, as you would usually
do (read django-registration doc), but add two parameters, this way:

    from usernameless.forms import UsernameLessAuthenticationForm
    ...
    (r'^accounts/', include('registration.backends.default.urls'), {
        'authentication_form': UsernameLessAuthenticationForm,
        'backend': 'usernameless.auth.UsernameLessRegistrationBackend',
    }),

The 'authentication_form' will override the auth form, the 'backend' will
override the registration backend.
The registration form is taken from the backend, so nothing more is to be
done.
The only remaining thing to override is the auth backend, which is done by
adding this to your settings.py: 

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'usernameless.auth.UsernameLessAuthenticationBackend',
    )

AND tweaks your template. There's no more 'username' but only 'email' and
'password' (or 'password1'/'password2') fields in forms.
